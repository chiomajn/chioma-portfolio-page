									<p>
										Lead a team of four design engineers to develop an assistive potato masher for a user with chronic fatigue.
										We adopted a user centred design philosophy, conducting interviews with our user and immersion studies to try to understand the daily challenges, needs and desires our user had.
										We analysed competitor products to find a niche in the market and produced a physical prototype of our final design.

									<p>
										Analysed the functional and user experiance design of a commercial juicer, and proposed improvements.
										I selected and measured appropriate usability KPI's for the juicer, and analysed behaviours of users interacting with the juicer to find pain points.
										I also performed a teardown of the juicer to learn how it worked, to document the materials used, and to assess manufacturing processes and costs.

									<h3>Racecar AI System</h3>
									<p>
										Worked as part of a team to develop a system to add self driving capability to an electric racecar. I was responsible for developing the localisation subsystem,
										which provides position estimates to the SLAM algorithm using visual odometry. I used Python to implement the localisation system, and ROS and Linux to run the system on a simulator running on Unreal Engine.
